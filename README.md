# puppet-homebrew

A Puppet Module to install Homebrew and manage Homebrew packages on Mac OS X.
This module can install using either homebrew or brewcask, along with a
fallback mode which attempts both.

puppet-homebrew is available on the
[Puppet Forge](https://forge.puppetlabs.com/thekevjames/homebrew).

## Usage

### Installing packages

Use the Homebrew package provider like this:

```puppet
class hightower::packages {
  pkglist = ['postgresql', 'nginx', 'git', 'tmux']

  package { $pkglist:
    ensure   => present,
    provider => brew,
  }
}
```

The providers works as follows:
* `provider => brew`: install using `brew install <module>`. Do not use
brewcask.
* `provider => brewcask`: install using `brew cask install <module>`. Only use
brewcask.
* `provider => homebrew`: attempt to install using `brew install <module>`. On
failure, use `brew cask install <module>`

### Tapping repositories

To tap into new Github repositories, simply use the tap provider:

```puppet
package { 'neovim/neovim':
  ensure   => present,
  provider => tap,
}
```

You can untap a repository by setting ensure to `absent`.

#### Ordering taps

When both tapping a repo and installing a package from that repository, it is
important to make sure the former happens first. This can be accomplished in a
few different ways: either by doing so on a per-package basis:

```puppet
package { 'neovim/neovim':
  ensure   => present,
  provider => tap,
} ->
package { 'neovim':
  ensure   => present,
  provider => homebrew,
}
```

or by setting all taps to occur before all other usages of this package with
[Resource Collectors](https://docs.puppet.com/puppet/latest/reference/lang_collectors.html):

```puppet
# pick whichever provider(s) are relevant
Package <| provider == tap |> -> Package <| provider == homebrew |>
Package <| provider == tap |> -> Package <| provider == brew |>
Package <| provider == tap |> -> Package <| provider == brewcask |>
```

### Installing brew

To install homebrew on a node (with a compiler already present!):

```puppet
class { 'homebrew':
  user  => 'hightower',
  group => 'developers',  # defaults to 'admin'
}
```

Though homebrew itself recommends you do not install homebrew as a root user,
it will work in that configuration and this may be more convenient for your
setup. Though this is not officially supported by puppet-homebrew, there is no
reason why this should not work and users have reported success in running
`class { 'homebrew': user => root, group => wheel }`. Feel free to report
issues if this does not work for you, but please mention that you were running
as root.

To install homebrew and a compiler (on Lion or later), eg.:

```puppet
class { 'homebrew':
  user                       => 'kevin',
  command_line_tools_package => 'command_line_tools_for_xcode_os_x_lion_april_2013.dmg',
  command_line_tools_source  => 'http://devimages.apple.com/downloads/xcode/command_line_tools_for_xcode_os_x_lion_april_2013.dmg',
}
```

N.B. the author of this module does not maintain a mirror to command_line_tools.
You may need to search for a copy if you use this method. At the time of this
writing, downloading the command line tools sometimes requires an Apple ID.
Sorry, dude!
